* [2018-3-31 Sat] Try to use jest to do the unit test.
Well, you need to run
#+begin_src sh
npm i -g jest
npm i --save-dev @types/jest
#+end_src
before you want to do the unit tests.
By the way, jest will automatically use babel-jest to pre-transpile your code to run something like 'await'.
Hm, so that I can test the one with ~Promise~.
* [2018-3-30 Fri] Follow the concept shown in the package [[https://github.com/shakyShane/json-ts][json-ts]].
I modified ~.gitignore~, ~tsconfig.json~ and ~package.json~ to tune this package to behave as that package.

Besides, I also add in a ts code named ~update-pageTexts.ts~ to see what will be happened.
* [2018-3-30 Fri] Initialize it
By executing

#+begin_src sh
mkdir i18n-page-texts
cd i18n-page-texts
npm init
git init
tsc --init
#+end_src

to Initialize it.
Then, commit it.
