* [2018-3-30 Fri] Follow the concept shown in the package [[https://github.com/shakyShane/json-ts][json-ts]].
I modified ~.gitignore~, ~tsconfig.json~ and ~package.json~ to tune this package to behave as that package.

Besides, I also add in a ts code named ~update-pageTexts.ts~ to see what will be happened.
* [2018-3-30 Fri] Initialize it
By executing

#+begin_src sh
mkdir i18n-page-texts
cd i18n-page-texts
npm init
git init
tsc --init
#+end_src

to Initialize it.
Then, commit it.
